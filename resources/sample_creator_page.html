When we see something inventive or unique, we want to be a part of that as soon as possible, because usually the first adopters of potentially disruptive technologies and ideas are fiercely rewarded.&nbsp;</li><li>Using Bitcoin ensures that funding is <span style="font-weight: bold;">international</span>. Bitpieces will fight fiercely to maintain its ability to be an <a href="https://bitpieces.com/FAQ#why_use_bitcoin_instead_of_dollars" target="_blank">international</a> funding platform, and uses Bitcoin to avoid becoming mired in the potential regulations of any one specific country. Bitpieces exists on the web, and is made for web-users, anywhere in the world.</li></ul></div><h3><br></h3><h3>Why does Bitpieces need funds?</h3><div><ul><li>Right now, Bitpieces is made by me,&nbsp;<a href="http://bitpieces.com/about" target="_blank">Tyler Houlihan</a>(bitpieces_dev1).&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">If this project picks up, I can hire some more developers to contribute to the site, adding features, and making the user experience more enjoyable for you guys.&nbsp;</span></li><li>My goal is to hire a full team; several more developers, a legal rep, marketing/sales, etc, in addition to&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">expanding the service and functionality.</span></li><li>Time is our most valuable resource, and right now it's spread working on multiple jobs and projects. B<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">ut the more profitable Bitpieces becomes, the more time I can devote to it.</span></li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3>What is the reward for owning Bitpieces?</h3><div><ul><li>First and foremost, I want to reward my funders for supporting the project. This wouldn't be possible if they didn't see value in my efforts, and I want to thank them.</li><li>Bitpieces, in order to encourage others to do the same, is starting out with a generous reward yield, of 2%. This means that for every year, owning pieces of this brand will start out paying around $.01 per piece per year. If you guys decide that the pieces are valuable to own, then the value of the pieces may increase. Be wary of both overvaluing, and undervaluing the pieces.</li><li>The initial availability will be limited, so be aware of that.</li><li>My pledge to you, is to always be forthcoming, answer questions, and make the experience of using this site as great as it can be.</li></ul><div><br></div></div><h3>Is Bitpieces safe?</h3></div><div><ul><li>Bitpieces has a 5-pillar safety platform, outlined <a href="http://bitpieces.com/FAQ#how_do_i_know_if_a_creator_is_safe" target="_blank">here</a>.</li><li>Bitpieces is still considered a beta level of security.</li><li>If you'd like to test out all the functionality, without using real money, head over to the test site, <a href="http://test.bitpieces.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</li></ul><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><h3>FAQ:</h3><div><ul><li>There is a DISQUS thread below, which I will be quick in answering.</li><li>&nbsp;I will also post answers to all the important questions on the <a href="http://bitpieces.com/FAQ" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.</li></ul><div><br></div></div><h3>Questions?</h3><div><ul><li>If you have any questions, feel free to use the DISQUS thread below.</li><li>If you have any issues, bugs, or feature requests for the site, create an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/tchoulihan/bitpieces" target="_blank">github repository</a>.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><h4>Thanks for contributing!
