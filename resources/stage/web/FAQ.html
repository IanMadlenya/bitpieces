          <h2 class="">What is Bitpieces?</h2>
          Bitpieces is a crowd-funding platform to get projects off the ground. Instead of promising
          a product after a funding goal is met, a <a href="#what_is_a_creator">creator</a> issues 
          <a href="#what_are_pieces">pieces</a>, at a certain price per piece, and promises 
          <a href="#what_are_rewards">rewards</a> for owning pieces. Rewards grow continuously over time, 
          from the moment they are bought. You can see how rewards are calculated 
          <a href="#how_are_rewards_calculated">
            here</a>.
            <hr class="col-md-12">
          </div>

          <div id="what_are_pieces">
            <h2>What are pieces?</h2>
            Pieces are little entities guaranteeing you rewards from a creator. In a sense,
            they represent your contribution to a creator's brand. When you buy pieces from a 
            <a href="#what_is_a_creator"> creator</a>, you are helping them fund their work.
            As their brand becomes more(or less)
            valuable, your pieces may rise or fall in value, based on the their brand strength,
            popularity, or supply and demand. However, the <a href="#what_are_rewards">rewards</a>
            you collect are unaffected by changes in the price or value of your pieces. 
            <br><br>Once you own pieces from a creator, you can <a href="#what_are_bids_and_asks">bid,
            and ask</a>, to sell your pieces on an open market.
            <hr class="col-md-12">
          </div> 
          <div id="what_is_a_creator">   
            <h2 class="">What is a creator?</h2>
            A creator is the term Bitpieces uses to refer to the content-creators who 
            are issuing pieces to raise funds.
            <hr class="col-md-12">
          </div>
          <div id="what_are_rewards">
            <h2 class="">What are rewards?</h2>
            Rewards are what content-creators pay to their funders. They usually start out
            miniscule, but as their project generates profits, they can change the reward
            to increase the value of their brand. Bitpieces differs from most systems in 
            that rewards are continuous; from the moment pieces are purchased, they start
            generating <a href="#how_are_rewards_calculated">rewards</a>. There are no specific dates at which rewards are payed out, 
            they can be withdrawn at any time.
            <hr class="col-md-12">
          </div>
          <div id="why_are_rewards_mandatory">
            <h2 class="">Why are rewards mandatory?</h2>
              Rewards are mandatory to make Bitpieces more secure for both creators and funders. 
              <br><br>
              It doesn't seem to make sense that 
              a creator would want to give any of the money they raise back to their funders, especially
              at first; but it is necessary to establish a <b>history of trust</b> between the two. 
              People fund projects because they are fans, but also because they want to reap the rewards of
              seeing their favorite brands and projects grow; and projects that give nothing back to 
              their funders don't instill trust.
              When you can see a plot over time of increasing rewards to funders, no matter how small,
              it helps to build trust. 

              <br><br>
              Creators who are just starting out should choose a miniscule reward, perhaps around 0.5-1% / year. 
              Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72">rule of 72</a>, a 0.5% return
              means that you can pay rewards to funders for ~70 years, making no profit, 
              and still have half of the funds you raised. Adjusted for inflation, the average growth per year 
              is about 2.7%, so a reward far above this is not advised.
            <hr class="col-md-12">
          </div>
          <div id="how_are_rewards_calculated">
            <h2 class="">How are rewards calculated?</h2>
            Mathematically, rewards are a rate over time, given as reward / piece / year.
            A creator can choose to change their reward, if their project starts earning more
            or less profits.
            <br><br> 
            As an example, if a creator issues 5000 pieces at 1 USD per piece, they might
            make their reward rate at .01 USD / piece / year, meaning a 1% reward yield. If a funder,
            buys 500 pieces for $500 dollars total, after one year, they will have earned 5$ in rewards.
            If the price per pieces stays roughly the same, their value after 1 year will be at
            $505 dollars. 

            <hr class="col-md-12">
          </div>

          <div id="does_price_affect_rewards">
            <h2 class="">Does price affect rewards?</h2>
            No. Since rewards are a rate of reward / <b>piece</b> / year, the price of the piece will not
            affect how much rewards are earned. However, a creator that provides a stable
            reward to their funders, will likely have the value of their pieces rise. Likewise,
            A creator who consistently lowers their rewards will likely have the value of their
            pieces decline. 

            <hr class="col-md-12">
          </div>



          <div id="how_do_i_know_if_a_creator_is_safe">
            <h2 class="">How do I know if a creator is safe?</h2>
            There are 5 safety measures Bitpieces has in place to protect creators and their funders.

            <ul>
              <li> 
                <h3> Verification</h3>
                Creators can officially link their content to their Bitpieces creator account. 
                Creators who have their official content linked to their account, are likely to be more
                trustworthy, because they wouldn't want to alienate their funders and fans. 
                <br><br>
                Unverified creators are considered <b>very unsafe</b>; they could be trying to impersonate another
                person in order to abscond with funds.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3> Mandatory rewards</h3>
                One of the oddities of Bitpieces, is this question: If a creator is trying to raise money, 
                then why should they be forced to reward their creators right away?
                <br><br>
                The answer is this: security. Rewards, no matter how miniscule the amount, help to establish 
                a <a href="why_are_rewards_mandatory">history of trust</a>. When you see that a creator has
                consistently paid their funders rewards, and has a history of increasing that amount, no matter
                how tiny it started off, it builds trust.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3> Creators safety ratings</h3>
                Since Bitpieces hosts creators funds, we know how long, given what they have currently in their 
                account, they can safely pay rewards to their funders. A safety rating of 10 means that a creator
                can safely pay 10 years of rewards to their funders, given what they currently have in their account. 
                When a creator makes a potential withdrawal, their post-withdrawal safety rating is displayed. 
                A creator who withdraws too much money, finds that their safety rating will also drop. 
                A plot of safety rating over time is visible from the creator's overview.
                <br><br>
                A history of safety ratings of <b>greater than 5</b> is considered safe.
                <br><br>

                Mathematically, creators safety is calculated as : Safety = creators funds/(reward/piece/year * 
                pieces owned) . 
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3> Open discussion threads </h3>
                In order to increase a dialog between creators and their funders, every creator's page has an
                embedded disqus thread. This can be used for answering questions, requesting content, or 
                giving updates. <b>Unresponsive</b> or unforthcoming creators are considered unsafe. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3> Transparency</h3>
                All creators activities, whether it be withdrawing funds, changing rewards, or issuing pieces,
                are visible on their main page. You can see their entire transaction and funding history, and make
                sure they are making safe decisions with their funders money.
              </li>
            </ul>
