          <h2 class="">What is Bitpieces?</h2>
          Bitpieces is a crowd-funding platform to get creative projects off the ground. Instead of promising
          a product after a funding goal is met, a <a href="#what_is_a_creator">creator</a> issues 
          <a href="#what_are_pieces">pieces</a>, at a certain price per piece, and promises 
          <a href="#what_are_rewards">rewards</a> for owning pieces. Rewards grow continuously over time, 
          from the moment pieces are bought. You can see how rewards are calculated 
          <a href="#how_are_rewards_calculated">here</a>. 
          <hr class="col-md-12">
        </div>

        <div id="what_are_pieces">
          <h2>What are pieces?</h2>
          Pieces are little entities guaranteeing you rewards from a creator. In a sense,
          they represent your contribution to a creator's brand. When you buy pieces from a 
          <a href="#what_is_a_creator"> creator</a>, you are helping them fund their work.
          As their brand becomes more(or less)
          valuable, your pieces may rise or fall in value, based on the their brand strength,
          popularity, or supply and demand. However, the <a href="#what_are_rewards">rewards</a>
          you collect are unaffected by changes in the price or value of your pieces. 
          <br><br>Once you own pieces from a creator, you can <a href="#what_are_bids_and_asks">bid,
          and ask</a>, to sell your pieces on an open market.
          <hr class="col-md-12">
        </div> 
        <div id="what_is_a_creator">   
          <h2 class="">What is a creator?</h2>
          A creator is the term Bitpieces uses to refer to the content-creators who 
          are issuing pieces to raise funds. A creator is not a project; it is a <b>brand</b>, which could potentially run many projects. A creator can refer to a single person, a group of people, or a company trying to raise money.
          <hr class="col-md-12">
        </div>
        <div id="what_are_rewards">
          <h2 class="">What are rewards?</h2>
          Rewards are what content-creators pay to their funders. They usually start out
          miniscule, but as their project generates profits, they can change the reward
          to increase the value of their brand. Bitpieces differs from most systems in 
          that rewards are continuous; from the moment pieces are purchased, they start
          generating <a href="#how_are_rewards_calculated">rewards</a>. There are no specific dates at which rewards are payed out, 
          they build in your account and can be withdrawn at any time.
          <hr class="col-md-12">
        </div>
        <div id="why_are_rewards_mandatory">
          <h2 class="">Why are rewards mandatory?</h2>
          Rewards are mandatory to make Bitpieces more <a href="#how_do_i_know_if_a_creator_is_safe">secure</a>
          for both creators and funders. 
          <br><br>
          It doesn't seem to make sense that 
          a creator would want to give any of the money they raise back to their funders, especially
          at first; but it is necessary to establish a <b>history of trust</b> between the two. 
          People fund projects because they are fans, but also because they want to reap the rewards of
          seeing their favorite brands and projects grow; and projects that give nothing back to 
          their funders don't instill trust.
          When you can see a plot over time of increasing rewards to funders, no matter how small,
          it helps to build that trust. 

          <br><br>
          Creators who are just starting out should choose a miniscule reward, perhaps around 0.5-1% / year. 
          Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72">rule of 72</a>, an initial 0.5% reward/piece/year 
          means that you can pay rewards to funders for ~70 years, making no profit, 
          and still have half of the funds you raised. Adjusted for inflation, the average growth per year 
          is about 2.7%, so a reward far above this is not advised. A reward greater than 7-8% is likely dangerous.
          <hr class="col-md-12">
        </div>
        <div id="how_are_rewards_calculated">
          <h2 class="">How are rewards calculated?</h2>
          Mathematically, rewards are a rate over time, given as reward / piece / year.
          A creator can choose to change their reward, if their project starts earning more
          or less profits.
          <br><br> 
          As an example, if a creator issues 5000 pieces at 1 USD per piece, they might
          make their reward rate at .01 USD / piece / year, meaning a 1% reward yield. If a funder,
          buys 500 pieces for $500 dollars total, after one year, they will have earned 5$ in rewards.
          If the price per pieces stays roughly the same, their value after 1 year will be at
          $505 dollars. Likewise, after one year, if all the pieces are bought, a creator will owe 
          around $50 per year to their funders. Using the rule of 72, they should be able to pay their
          funders for 35 years before they reach half their initial funds.

          <hr class="col-md-12">
        </div>

        <div id="how_is_worth_calculated">
          <h2 class="">How is worth calculated?</h2>
          After a creator sells all their pieces, funders may want to bid and ask on the pieces that are already
          in the market. This means that if a piece was initially sold for $1, someone might be willing to buy it later on at 
          $2. 
          <br><br> 
          This means that there are two distinct numbers for a creator's value: <b>Worth</b>, and funds raised. While funds raised is
          simply the money that the creators made by selling pieces to funders, worth is the total value of all the pieces combined.
          <br><br>
          If a creator raised $100, by selling 100 pieces at $1/piece, and the price per piece later on increases to $2, then the 
          creators worth is now $200, and the funds they raised is still $100.

          <hr class="col-md-12">
        </div>

        <div id="does_price_affect_rewards">
          <h2 class="">Does price affect rewards?</h2>
          No. Since rewards are a rate of reward / <b>piece</b> / year, the price of the piece will not
          affect how much rewards are earned. However, a creator that provides a stable
          reward to their funders, will likely have the value of their pieces rise. Likewise,
          A creator who consistently lowers their rewards will likely have the value of their
          pieces decline. 

          <hr class="col-md-12">
        </div>



        <div id="how_do_i_know_if_a_creator_is_safe">
          <h2 class="">How do I know if a creator is safe?</h2>
          There are 5 safety measures Bitpieces has in place to protect creators and their funders.

          <ul>
            <li> 
              <h3> Verification</h3>
              Creators can officially link their content to their Bitpieces creator account. 
              Creators who have their official content linked to their account, are likely to be more
              trustworthy, because they wouldn't want to alienate their funders and fans. 
              <br><br>
              Unverified creators are considered <b>very unsafe</b>; they could be trying to impersonate another
              person in order to abscond with funds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3> Mandatory rewards</h3>
              One of the oddities of Bitpieces, is in this question: If a creator is trying to raise money, 
              then why should they be forced to reward their creators right away?
              <br><br>
              The answer is this: security. Rewards, no matter how miniscule the amount, help to establish 
              a <a href="why_are_rewards_mandatory">history of trust</a>. When you see that a creator has
              consistently paid their funders rewards, and has a history of increasing that amount, no matter
              how tiny it started off, it builds trust.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3> Creators safety ratings</h3>
              Since Bitpieces hosts creators funds, we know how long, given what they have currently in their 
              account, they can safely pay rewards to their funders. A safety rating of 10 means that a creator
              can safely pay <b>10 years of rewards</b> to their funders, given what they currently have in their account. 
              When a creator makes a potential withdrawal, their post-withdrawal safety rating is displayed to them,
              to make sure they aren't withdrawing too much, so that their users might feel unsafe.
              Creators are expected to withdraw their funds, that's why they're here. But they should only withdraw
              so much as to make their funders comfortable. 
              A plot of safety rating over time is visible from the creator's overview. Withdrawals will appear as 
              spikes down, and when they sell pieces, you will see upward surges.
              <br><br>
              A history of safety ratings of <b>greater than 5</b> is considered safe.
              <br><br>

              Mathematically, creators safety is calculated as : Safety = creators funds/(reward/piece/year * 
              pieces owned) . 
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3> Open discussion threads </h3>
              In order to increase a dialog between creators and their funders, every creator's page has an
              embedded disqus thread. This can be used for answering questions, requesting content, or 
              giving updates. <b>Unresponsive</b> or unforthcoming creators are considered unsafe. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3> Transparency</h3>
              All creators activities, whether it be withdrawing funds, changing rewards, or issuing pieces,
              are visible on their main page. You can see their entire transaction and funding history, and make
              sure they are making safe decisions with their funders money.
            </li>
          </ul>


          <hr class="col-md-12">
        </div>

        <div id="what_are_bids_and_asks">
          <h2 class="">What are bids and asks?</h2>
          After pieces are bought from the creator, they can be sold(ask issue) or bought(bid issue)
          on an open market. Bids and asks contain 3 pieces of information: 
          <ul>
            <li> The <b>price</b> of the bid or ask</li>
            <li> The <b>number of pieces</b> you want to buy or sell</li>
            <li> A <b>day</b> on which this order expires</li>
          </ul>

          After a bid or ask is issued, they are compared randomly with other bids and asks for that
          creator. If a bidding price is above the asking price, the maximum number of pieces in common
          are exchanged. If there are pieces leftover, a new bid or ask is issued for the remaining pieces,
          with the same expiration date as before. The system benefits askers over bidders, because the price 
          taken for the transaction is the high bidding price. This discourages unnecessary bidding up of the 
          price. 

          <br><br>

          An example is as follows: 
          <ul>
            <li> Bill makes an ask for 5 pieces for $1/piece, expiring in a week. </li>
            <li> Tom makes a bid for 3 pieces at $2/piece, expiring also in a week. </li>
            <li> The sale is made at $2/piece for 3 pieces. </li>
            <li> Another ask is automatically issued for bill for the remaining 2 pieces at $1/piece, expiring at the 
              same time as before. </li>
            </ul>

            Tom now has 3 pieces, and gave Bill a total of $6 for them.



            <hr class="col-md-12">
          </div>
          <div id="what_are_the_fees">
            <h2 class="">What are the fees for using Bitpieces?</h2>
            For funders of projects, Bitpieces is completely free. Bitpieces uses 
            <a href="https://coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> as a payment processor,
            which currently has zero fees for Bitpieces transactions. When not using coinbase,
            you will incur a .0001-.0002 BTC transaction fee when you first buy pieces. Buying the initial pieces, or issuing bids
            and asks is a zero-fee process. Withdrawals, after selling pieces, are also entirely free.

            <br><br>
            For creators, there are no startup fees, but each withdrawal of funds raised incurs a 5% fee on the
            withdrawal amount. This is in line with other crowd funding websites.

            <h2 class="">Why use bitcoin instead of dollars?</h2>
            Bitpieces was envisioned as an international crowd-funding platform, being able to fund
            musicians, communities, comic book artists, writers, or video creators across the globe. As such,
            a global, unregulated currency with its own transaction processing network like Bitcoin
            is perfect for funding creators anywhere in the world.

            In a word, <a href="#how_do_i_know_if_a_creator_is_safe">funder safety</a>. Bitpieces hosts a completely 
            transparent, open network, where you can see how much a creator has raised, and how long
            they can guarantee rewards to their funders. The network for buying and selling 
            pieces, and of earning continuous rewards, is provided by Bitpieces. Bitpieces also provides
            a user experience that makes the dialog between creators and their funders direct, 
            and unhindered.

            <h2 class="">How does currency conversion work?</h2>
            All transactions, such as withdrawing or depositing, buying, bidding, asking, are 
            done in BTC. If a user has chosen USD as their primary currency, any price field
            is converted to BTC. Historical, and current-time conversions,
            are done using <a href="https://bitcoinaverage.com/#USD">Bitcoinaverage.com's API</a>, and 
            updated every 15 minutes.
